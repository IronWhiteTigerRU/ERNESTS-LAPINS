Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?

Our minds were racing and time went slow

If there was trouble in the world we didn't know

If we had a care, it didn't show

But now I worry our horizon's bear nothing new

'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it, too

We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop

'Cause what we did one day on a whim

Has slowly become all we do

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives

I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die

And now I fear we might

Oh, now I fear we might

But it's okay, I think thee's a way

Why don't we just say one more year?

(One more year)

Not worrying if I get the right amount of sleep

(One more year)

Not caring if we do the same thing every week

(One more year)

Of living like I'm only living for me

(One more year)

Of never talking about where we're gonna be

(One more year)

One more year

Of living like the free spirit I wanna be

We got a whole year

(One more year) Fifty-two weeks

Seven days each

(One more year) Four seasons, one reason

One way, one year

(One more year)

One year, one year

From today (From today)

From today (From today)

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives

Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
